      "IT expert, delivering tech solutions through analysis, automation, and leadership.\n",
      "Results-driven IT professional with over 10 years of cross-functional experience delivering technology-driven solutions across the U.S. healthcare and financial capital markets. Adept at aligning business goals with innovative technical strategies, I specialize in identifying operational inefficiencies and translating complex business needs into scalable, actionable technology initiatives. I have consistently led the end-to-end delivery of projects—managing budgets, timelines, and stakeholder expectations—while ensuring alignment with regulatory and compliance frameworks such as HIPAA.\n",
      "As a Consultant, I empower small businesses through tailored digital solutions using no-code/low-code tools like n8n and RPA platforms such as Power Automate and UiPath. I build scalable workflows, AI-powered chatbots, and automation systems that streamline sales, customer support, and operations. Integrations span Slack, HubSpot, OpenAI, and more—enabling intelligent data processing, lead management, and real-time insights through executive summaries, OCR, and GPT-powered automation.\n",
      "Recognized for delivering robust business analysis, process optimization, and comprehensive documentation, including BRDs, FRDs, user stories, and workflows. I bring strong facilitation skills to the table, leading cross-functional teams in stakeholder discovery sessions, JAD meetings, UAT coordination, and change management initiatives. My consultative approach and ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and business units have contributed to the successful implementation of enterprise applications, integrations, and cloud migrations.\n",
      "Specialized in quality engineering, test automation framework design, and DevOps implementation with hands-on experience using modern tools and practices. I have developed and maintained automated testing pipelines using Selenium, Postman, and other open-source tools, ensuring continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) in fast-paced environments. Whether operating within traditional Waterfall models or adapting to Agile and Hybrid frameworks, I bring a flexible, structured approach that promotes collaboration, transparency, and high-quality delivery at scale.\n",
